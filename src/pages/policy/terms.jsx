                <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
                <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
                informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and
                exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE
                RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
                Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the
                AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are
                available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
                shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The
                arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The
                arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by
                either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator
                fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the
                arbitration will take place in Hamilton County, Tennessee. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
                Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,
                modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br /><br /> If for any reason, a
                Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state
                and federal courts located in Hamilton County, Tennessee, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all
                defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction
                in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
                International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from
                these Terms of Use.<br /><br /> If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
                will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
                unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
                listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
                court.

                <h2>Restrictions</h2> The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
                between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined
                with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
                class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any
                Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
                persons.

                <h2>Exceptions to Arbitration</h2>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not
                subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
                protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute
                related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c)
                any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
                Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal
                or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
                listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
                court.

                <h2>CORRECTIONS</h2>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors,
                inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information. I
