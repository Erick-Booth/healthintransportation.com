                out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law

                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
                either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

                <h2 id='8'>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
                In Short: we do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
                We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the

                supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here:

                <h2 id='10'>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
                not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
                technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
                revised version of this privacy policy.

                California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in

                website, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on

                accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by
                prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
                encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting
